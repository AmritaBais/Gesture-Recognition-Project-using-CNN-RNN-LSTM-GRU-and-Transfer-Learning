# Gesture-Recognition-Project-using-CNN-RNN-LSTM-GRU-and-Transfer-Learning
Task was to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command: Gesture Corresponding Action Thumbs Up Increase the volume. Thumbs Down Decrease the volume. Left Swipe 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds. Right Swipe 'Jump' forward 10 seconds. Stop Pause the movie.
